JWT stands for Json Web Token
JWT is mostly used for securing Rest APIs.
BEst way to communicate security between client and server securely.
JWT follows a stateless authentication mechanism
-> Header : algo + type
-> payload : information about Claims
-> signature : encoder header + encoder payload + key

steps to implement JWT
1) add dependency(io.jsonwebtoken)
2) create JWTAuthenticationEntryPoint implements AuthenticateEntryPoint(interface)
   override to method  in that class, when will be executed unauthorized  user  access api  to  exception handler
3) Create JWTTokenHelper -> token operation like generate, validation, expiration
4) JWtAuthenticationFilter extends OnceRequestFilter
    reach to server before intercept  checked from header present token and also set context security enable
    -> get jwt token from request and well format
    -> Validate token
    -> Load user associated with token
    -> set spring security ( set authentication into spring security)
    -> go head to next server
5) create JwtAuthResponse
    ->token, user details field
6) configuration JWT in spring config
7) create login api to return token -> username, password -> authenticate from database and generated token
8) Test the application
